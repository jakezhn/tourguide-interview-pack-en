### English Spoken Script (~470 words)

Good morning, everyone! Welcome to Hangzhou, and thanks for letting me spend the day with you. I hope these next few hours leave you with the happiest memories of our “paradise city.”

Back home we often quote the line, “In heaven there is paradise; on earth there are Suzhou and Hangzhou.” It sounds poetic, but when you stroll around here you’ll see why people have been saying that for centuries.

Hangzhou lies on China’s southeast coast in Zhejiang Province, right where the Qiantang River meets the southern end of the Grand Canal. With an area of roughly 16,850 square kilometres and a population of nearly 12.5 million, it’s the political, economic, cultural, and transportation centre of the province.

Even the city’s name has a story. In ancient Chinese, “Hang” referred to a boat and “Zhou” meant a city, so Hangzhou literally describes a city that you can sail right into.

That “boat-friendly” idea is still around today. The city runs four major railway stations, an extensive high-speed rail network, and the busy Xiaoshan International Airport, which connects us to Bangkok, Singapore, Doha, Amsterdam, and many other destinations.

People have lived on this soil for roughly eight thousand years, so history and culture are woven into daily life. In the 13th century, Marco Polo called Hangzhou the most beautiful and splendid city in the world, and the city has worked hard ever since to live up to that compliment.

The climate is subtropical monsoon: warm, humid, and full of variety. Spring gives us soft rains, summer is steamy and lush, autumn is clear and crisp, and winter can be chilly and damp. Every season paints the city with a different palette, which means there’s never a bad time to visit.

We’re also famous for specialty products. Keep an eye out for Hangzhou silk, Longjing green tea, Zhang Xiaoquan scissors, and Wang Xing Ji fans. They make wonderful gifts—or souvenirs for yourself.

Hangzhou is known as the capital of love because so many classic romances were set here, including “The Butterfly Lovers” and “The Legend of the White Snake.” Beyond romance, people describe the city as smart, innovative, and full of life. It’s consistently ranked as one of China’s best places to live, and locals often say they lead a poetic lifestyle.

Landmarks are everywhere you turn: West Lake, Lingyin Temple, Xixi Wetland, Leifeng Pagoda, and countless hidden gems in the old neighbourhoods. Today we’ll sample a few highlights, but trust me—you’ll want to come back and explore more.

So take a deep breath, relax into the pace of the day, and let Hangzhou charm you. If you need anything, just let me know. Enjoy the tour, my friends!

## Script 1 · 浙江省情

### English Spoken Script (~1,030 words)

Good morning again, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Picturesque Zhejiang—my home province and one of China’s most talked-about destinations. Whenever people mention Zhejiang, phrases like “land of fish and rice,” “land of silk,” and “land of culture” quickly follow, and after today you’ll understand why.

Zhejiang stretches along China’s southeast coast, forming the southern wing of the Yangtze River Delta. The mighty Qiantang River, once called Zhijiang, slices through the province and even lends Zhejiang its name. The province covers about 105,500 square kilometres, just 1.1% of China’s land, yet we pack in more than 66 million people—so it’s compact, energetic, and full of opportunity.

The terrain is dramatic. Seven parts mountains, one part water, and only two parts farmland—that old saying really sums it up. Hills and valleys roll into each other, with rivers zigzagging through. The subtropical monsoon climate keeps things warm and humid, with four very distinct seasons and an annual average temperature of 15 to 18 degrees Celsius.

Zhejiang administers 11 prefecture-level cities, including the capital Hangzhou and the port powerhouse Ningbo. Transportation is a breeze: nine civilian airports connect us to the world, the high-speed rail network now extends over 1,800 kilometres, and ferries dash between Ningbo, Zhoushan, and Shanghai across what we lovingly call the “Golden Triangle” of sea travel.

History here is measured in tens of thousands of years. Archaeologists have identified “Jiande Man” communities from 50,000 years ago. Hemudu Culture flourished 7,000 years ago, Liangzhu Culture 5,000 years ago, all proving that Neolithic civilisation thrived here long before recorded history. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, the Grand Canal turned Hangzhou into a superstar city, and by the Southern Song Dynasty, the city was the nation’s capital and one of the world’s greatest metropolises. Ningbo, meanwhile, shone as a major port on the Maritime Silk Road.

Today Zhejiang is still a national trendsetter. The economy, politics, society, and ecological development all rank among the best in China. We often call Zhejiang a “laboratory of reform” because so many of the country’s innovation policies are piloted here.

You’ll also notice how rich the culture is. Eleven items from Zhejiang appear on UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity—everything from Longquan celadon firing techniques and Kunqu Opera to the legendary tales of the White Snake. If you love shopping for souvenirs, you’re in luck. Hangzhou silk, Longjing green tea, Zhang Xiaoquan scissors, Wang Xing Ji fans, and Qingtian stone carvings are classic favourites.

Tourism resources are abundant. Zhejiang boasts 21 national 5A scenic spots and four UNESCO World Heritage properties: West Lake, the Zhejiang section of the Grand Canal, the Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City, and the natural wonder Jianglang Mountain. The idea here is to blend natural landscapes with human stories—mountains, rivers, lakes, temples, and old towns are all part of the same experience.

To make travel planning easier, the province promotes four major metropolitan areas. Downtown Hangzhou teams up with Huzhou, Jiaxing, and Shaoxing to form the Hangzhou Metropolitan Area. This zone focuses on urban leisure, waterfront vacations, and classic water towns. Imagine drifting across West Lake in the morning, discovering Grand Canal heritage in the afternoon, and sharing tea in an ancient town like Wuzhen or Xitang in the evening.

Further east, Ningbo and Zhoushan build a maritime-and-religion-focused metro area. Zhoushan Island—the fourth largest in China—is a paradise for island hopping and fishermen’s culture. And if you’re curious about Buddhism, Mount Putuo is a must-see. It’s the sacred site of Guanyin and one of China’s four great Buddhist mountains, praised as the “Buddhist Kingdom on the Sea.”

South of there lies the Wenzhou–Taizhou Metropolitan Area. It highlights rugged mountains, folk customs, and religious heritage. Yandang Mountain dazzles with cliffs and waterfalls, Nanxi River meanders past ancient villages, and Tiantai Mountain carries deep connections to both Taoism and Buddhism.

The final metropolitan cluster covers Jinhua and Yiwu. It’s where commerce, culture, and creativity overlap. Yiwu International Trade City gives you a taste of global small-commodity trading, while Hengdian World Studios lets you walk straight into China’s movie industry.

These four hubs radiate outwards, drawing travellers to other corners such as Quzhou and Lishui. Places like Nianbadu Ancient Town and the Yunhe Terraces are becoming household names. Everywhere you go, you feel the province’s push toward “integrated tourism,” meaning the entire region works together to share resources and deliver consistent, high-quality experiences.

Innovation keeps tourism fresh. Zhejiang has rolled out rural holidays, maritime adventures, study tours, wellness retreats, and even digital immersive products. Personalised, differentiated itineraries are the new normal here.

That wraps up my overview of Zhejiang. Thank you for listening, and I truly hope you fall in love with this charming province. If anything piques your interest, let me know—I’m happy to dive deeper while we travel together. Enjoy every moment in Picturesque Zhejiang!

## Script 2 · 大运河（浙江段）

### English Spoken Script (~1,100 words)

Friends, our next story takes place along the Zhejiang stretch of the Grand Canal—the southern jewel of the world’s longest man-made waterway. Hop off the coach, stretch your legs, and let the past speak. I’ll walk you through how this engineering miracle shaped Hangzhou and the province.

Two and a half millennia ago, people here were already digging strategic canals. By the Sui Dynasty, Hangzhou officially became the southern terminus of the Grand Canal. Imagine the scene: barges piled with grain, silk, porcelain, and salt moving day and night; imperial envoys dispatching orders; scholars and artists drifting south to seek inspiration. No wonder the canal, together with the Great Wall and Xinjiang’s Karez wells, is hailed as one of ancient China’s three mega projects.

The canal we admire today stretches more than 3,200 kilometres, crosses eight provinces and municipalities, and links five great river systems. Zhejiang’s section is called the “Official River” in the history books, because the government planned, funded, and managed every lock and levee. That administrative attention kept the province’s economy humming right up to the modern era. Even now, about 80 percent of Hangzhou’s cargo volume travels by water—remarkable in an age obsessed with trucks and airplanes.

The canal’s cultural status is just as impressive. Poets in every dynasty floated down to Zhejiang and left lyrical snapshots of cities, bridges, and markets. In 2014, UNESCO added the Grand Canal to the World Heritage List, and the Zhejiang section alone accounts for 18 of the inscribed sites. In 2019, it became one of Zhejiang’s four themed “poetry roads,” a figurative term for scenic corridors that merge nature and culture.

Today we’re standing in Xiaohe Street Historical Block. It used to be an industrial and residential quarter along the canal; now it’s a living museum. One minute you’re sipping tea in a century-old shophouse, the next you’re nibbling local snacks in a trendy café. Restoration work encouraged 60 percent of original residents to move back, which is the best compliment an urban renewal project can receive. No surprise the United Nations honoured Xiaohe with a human-settlements award.

Take a wander for the next half hour. Step onto the stone pier, photograph the boats gliding past, or just breathe in the mix of river mist and roasting coffee beans. Please be back by 10:30—we’ll board a boat at the dock right behind me.

Great, everyone is back. Please watch your step as you board. The canal water looks calm, but the current is stronger than you think, so keep phones and cameras secure. I’d hate to fish a brand-new smartphone out of the “new treasure vault” at the bottom.

On your left is the Canal Culture Square, home to the Beijing–Hangzhou Grand Canal Museum. On your right is Qiaoxi Historical Block, a cluster of repurposed factories now filled with design studios, galleries, and craft shops. Straight ahead you can already spot Gongchen Bridge. Its name comes from a Confucian ideal about “winning the hearts of the people,” and if you squint you’ll notice the bridge looks like someone bowing to greet the imperial barge. This elegant arch marks the canal’s southern terminus and remains Hangzhou’s tallest and longest stone bridge.

As we drift underneath, look up toward the two pier guardians—they’re “water beasts” carved to ward off floods. Once we dock, we’ll climb the bridge for a panoramic view and then descend on the other side.

Welcome to the museum quarter. Those brick buildings used to be warehouses; today they house the Hangzhou Arts and Crafts Museum plus three national-level collections: the Chinese Umbrella Museum, the Chinese Fan Museum, and the Chinese Knife, Scissor and Sword Museum. Together they tell the story of Hangzhou’s artisans—why this city became synonymous with silk umbrellas, sandalwood fans, and razor-sharp scissors. Feel free to experiment with the interactive exhibits; you can even try assembling a bamboo-ribbed umbrella if time allows.

Before we wrap up this canal experience, let me emphasise a few practical notes. The canal banks are narrow in places, so stay alert when you take photos. If you’re tempted to shop, Xiaohe Street has plenty of respectable vendors—bargain politely, and carry small change if you’re buying handmade crafts. Lastly, respect the residents: people still live upstairs in many of the old houses, so keep voices low in the alleys.

The Grand Canal isn’t just an old trench filled with water. It’s the beating heart that linked north and south China, shaped Zhejiang’s economy, and inspired poets and planners alike. I hope this visit leaves you with the same awe I feel every time I stand on Gongchen Bridge and watch the boats glide by. Ready to move on? Let’s head back to the coach and continue our journey.

## Script 4 · 良渚古城遗址

### English Spoken Script (~1,050 words)

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City—UNESCO calls it “the sacred ground that demonstrates 5,000 years of Chinese civilisation.” We’re standing in the cradle of a late Neolithic culture that flourished between 5,300 and 4,300 years ago in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin.

Liangzhu’s story unfolds through three major components: the grand walled city, the sophisticated outer water conservancy system, and the Yaoshan altar complex. Together, they present the earliest known example of a planned capital in East Asia. Imagine a society with specialised craftsmen, stratified classes, organised religion, and far-reaching trade routes—all long before bronze weapons appeared in the Central Plains.

Today’s ruins park doubles as a wetland reserve. The ancient city rose from a network of rivers and lakes, so modern conservation keeps the reed beds and waterways intact. The actual ruins hide beneath the soil for protection. The outlines you see—highlighted with metal grids or planted embankments—show where gates, palaces, and ceremonial squares once stood. Please stay on walkways; even a careless footprint could damage something priceless underground.

Our first stop is the sole land gate among Liangzhu’s nine gates. The others were water gates, emphasising how residents moved primarily by boat. Archaeologists recreated the bustling scene with metal silhouettes of people, ox carts, and even dogs—the same faithful companions we keep today.

We then ascend the Mojiao Mountain Palace District. This massive rammed-earth platform towers ten metres above the plain. Liangzhu rulers believed “lofty heights command respect,” so they stacked three smaller terraces on top: Greater Mojiao, Lesser Mojiao, and Turtle Mountain. On Greater Mojiao, excavators found seven house foundations, each about 200 square metres. Just beyond stretches a 70,000-square-metre sand square that likely hosted rituals or military parades.

Next is Fanshan Cemetery, the highest-ranking burial ground discovered so far. Over 1,200 grave goods surfaced from this site, more than 90 percent carved from jade. Jade cong, jade yue, and jade bi formed ritual sets representing divine, royal, and military power. Many bear the famous “divine human-beast” motif—a symbol of shared faith and authority. Liangzhu’s mastery of jade carving influenced Chinese ritual art for millennia afterward.

Equally mind-blowing is the hydraulic system outside the city: 11 large dams, 5 major reservoirs, and countless channels. UNESCO recognises this as the world’s earliest large-scale flood-control project. It worked as a moated defence, an irrigation network, and a transport artery all at once. When you look across the wetlands, try to picture ancient engineers shaping the landscape with nothing but earth, wood, and ingenuity.

Before we finish, a few reminders. The park is huge, so shuttles are available if anyone needs a break. Bring water, wear sunscreen, and be respectful when you see archaeologists at work—photography is fine, but don’t cross cordoned-off areas. Most importantly, absorb the fact that long before the Xia or Shang dynasties, Liangzhu people already operated a complex state. That’s why we say Chinese civilisation is “five thousand years old and counting.”

## Script 5 · 嘉兴市桐乡乌镇古镇旅游区

### English Spoken Script (~1,000 words)

Next, we journey to Wuzhen, the “last water town” between Suzhou and Hangzhou. The Grand Canal slices through town, so you can sense how river trade shaped daily life over the past millennium.

Wuzhen splits into two scenic zones. Dongzha (East Gate) preserves living traditions—silk-dyeing workshops, woodcarving studios, and narrow alleys where residents still hang laundry above the canal. Xizha (West Gate) blends culture with leisure—boutique inns, lantern-lit night cruises, and coffee shops tucked inside old granaries. Together they formed the stage for the World Internet Conference in 2014, proving that ancient charm and digital innovation can share the same postcode.

As we wander through Dongzha, keep your eyes open for the Hundred-Bed Museum, whose crown jewel is the Qing Dynasty “Babu Qiangong” bed carved from camphor wood. Nearby stands the former residence of Muxin (Sun Pu), the Wuzhen-born writer and artist who inspired generations with his dreamy prose and paintings.

Cross over to Xizha and you’ll meet the 51.75-metre White Lotus Pagoda, wetlands lined with wooden boardwalks, and night markets selling everything from handmade fans to creative desserts. When the lanterns switch on at dusk, the reflections on the canal create a scene worthy of any painting.

Wuzhen survives because conservation focused on people, not just buildings. Restoration encouraged original residents to return, and their presence keeps the dialect, food, and festivals alive. When you shop, try to buy from workshops where artisans are on site—they’ll happily explain how they dye silk or brew rice wine. Bargain with a smile and keep small change handy.

Practical tips: cobblestones become slick after rain, so wear grippy shoes. Motor vehicles are restricted, but electric boats and shuttles help when legs get tired. Respect locals’ privacy, especially at night, and don’t throw coins into the canal; the water needs to stay clean for both heritage and ecology.

By the end of the visit, you’ll see why Wuzhen ranks among China’s top ancient towns—its bridges, waterways, and human warmth offer a gentle pause from city life.

## Script 6 · 舟山市普陀山风景名胜区

### English Spoken Script (~980 words)

Now we set sail for Mount Putuo, part of Zhoushan’s island chain and one of the four Buddhist mountains of China. Pilgrims have crossed these waters for over a thousand years to pay homage to Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.

Upon docking, you’ll notice the salty wind mingled with incense. Our first landmark is the 18-metre South Sea Guanyin statue. Counting the lotus pedestal and the merit hall beneath, the structure rises 33 metres—symbolising the Bodhisattva’s thirty-three manifestations. Pilgrims walk clockwise, offer incense, and whisper prayers for peace.

The “Unwilling-to-Leave Guanyin Temple” stands nearby. Legend says a monk tried to carry a statue overseas, but the statue refused to move, so a temple was built on the spot. The current hall was reconstructed in 2001 and remains an important stop for devotees.

Deep inside the island, we’ll pass the 13.5-metre hornbeam tree—over 200 years old and considered one of Putuo’s three treasures. Eventually we reach Puji Temple, the island’s largest monastery. Inside the Heavenly Kings Hall, Maitreya greets us with a smile, Weituo protects the rear, and the Four Heavenly Kings stand vigilant on both sides. The temple complex stretches over ponds, courtyards, and prayer halls; chanting often mingles with the crashing waves outside.

Practical reminders: Putuo involves a lot of climbing, so wear comfortable shoes and carry water. Dress modestly inside temples—no bare shoulders or loud slogans on shirts. When lighting incense, use the designated burners and never leave flames unattended. The island weather changes quickly, so carry a light raincoat.

Before leaving, check out the fishing villages dotted along the coast. Putuo locals still dry seaweed on rooftops and mend nets at the pier. Buying a few local snacks supports their livelihood, but bargain politely and avoid blocking narrow lanes.

Watching the sun set into the East China Sea, you’ll understand why Mount Putuo is called the “Buddhist Kingdom on the Sea.” Whether you came for faith or scenery, the serenity of the island stays with you.

## Script 7 · 义乌小商品城

### English Spoken Script (~1,050 words)

Our final stop is Yiwu International Trade City—the world’s largest wholesale market for small commodities. This is where “Made in China” trinkets meet buyers from every continent.

Yiwu lies in central Zhejiang, about 150 kilometres from Hangzhou. In the early 1980s, farmers set up barter stalls—exchanging chicken feathers for sugar—a quirky beginning to what is now a global marketplace. Today the Futian Market complex houses five districts, 75,000 booths, and more than 400,000 product types. Markets open around nine in the morning, close after five, and host buyers from over 200 countries daily.

Each district specialises. District 1 deals in artificial flowers, jewellery, and toys. District 2 features luggage, hardware, and small home appliances. District 3 showcases stationery, sporting goods, and cosmetics. District 4 offers hosiery, gloves, and textiles, while District 5 presents imported goods and bedding. Moving walkways connect the halls, so plan your route or you’ll walk miles without realising it.

To shop like a pro:

1. **Bring business cards or QR codes.** Suppliers scan them to remember your requirements.
2. **Know the MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity).** Most booths sell by cartons or dozens rather than single pieces. Samples are negotiable but not guaranteed.
3. **Use on-site services.** Freight forwarders, inspection agencies, and customs offices sit right inside the market. You can place an order, book shipment, and track the package before leaving the complex.
4. **Respect intellectual property.** Yiwu authorities shut down counterfeit booths quickly. Work with authorised factories and sign clear contracts covering trademarks and packaging.

Yiwu doubles as an international community. You’ll hear multiple languages, see halal restaurants next to Sichuan noodle shops, and watch live-stream hosts promoting new gadgets to online shoppers. At night, head to the exotic street near Binwang Market to experience global food culture.

If you need a break from commerce, visit Xiuhu Park or the nearby Fotang Ancient Town. But most visitors find the excitement right inside Futian Market—the endless shelves of creative gadgets, seasonal decorations, and made-to-order souvenirs.

Key reminders: wear comfortable shoes, keep receipts, and be cautious with cash—banks on-site handle secure transfers. When bargaining, smile and stay patient; long-term relationships are worth more than shaving a few yuan off a deal.

That wraps up our eight-minute whirlwind through Yiwu. Whether you’re a professional buyer or a curious traveller, I hope you’ve felt the entrepreneurial spirit that keeps this market buzzing day and night.

## Script 3 · 杭州市西湖风景名胜区

### English Spoken Script (~1,120 words)

Welcome back to Hangzhou proper, everyone. The next chapter of our journey unfolds around West Lake—the city’s signature postcard, poem, and love letter all rolled into one. People in China like to say, “Among the 36 West Lakes, Hangzhou’s is the best.” Today we’ll see exactly why.

West Lake nestles against the western edge of the old city, embraced by hills on three sides. It covers 6.4 square kilometres—big enough to explore for days, yet intimate enough to feel personal. According to legend, the lake was a pearl dropped from heaven, guarded forever by a dragon and a phoenix. According to geology, it was once a shallow bay connected to the Qiantang River until tidal silt sealed it off. Either story adds flavour to the scenery.

People often summarise West Lake’s layout as “one hill, two pagodas, three islets, three causeways, and five lake basins.” Since the Southern Song Dynasty, scholars identified ten iconic views that capture the harmony between humans and nature. In 2011, UNESCO recognised the West Lake Cultural Landscape as the only “lake-themed” World Heritage site in China.

We’ll start by boarding a cruise boat, so please watch your step and keep valuables secure. While we drift, I’ll point out a few highlights and then give you time to wander on foot.

First up, Su Causeway. It runs 2.8 kilometres north to south, lined with six stone bridges and willows that sprout earlier than anywhere else around the lake. That early spring greenery earned it the top spot among the Ten Views: “Spring Dawn at Su Causeway.” The causeway is named after Su Dongpo—also known as Su Shi—the Northern Song poet and statesman. When he returned to govern Hangzhou, he found the lake half silted and organised 200,000 workers to dredge it, piling the mud into this raised road so people could stroll between the banks. Locals still praise Su Dongpo for flood control, for fighting plagues, and yes, for inventing Dongpo Pork. Apparently townsfolk kept delivering wine and pork to thank him, so he braised everything together and shared it with the labourers.

Now hold up a one-yuan banknote and flip it over. See that moonlit scene? That’s “Three Pools Mirroring the Moon.” You’re looking at three hollow stone pagodas rising from the water. Each stands about two metres tall with five round holes. On Mid-Autumn night, locals light candles inside, cover the holes with thin paper, and the reflections multiply across the lake. With one moon in the sky and ten reflections from each pagoda, you get thirty-three moons in total—the last one is the moon in your heart, representing the people you miss. That’s the gentle romance of West Lake.

We’ll disembark near Broken Bridge, the most famous bridge around the lake. Legend says White Snake met Xu Xian here and fell instantly in love. Why call it “broken” if nothing has collapsed? In winter, snow on the sunny side melts earlier than on the shady side, creating the illusion of a gap. That scene is immortalised as “Lingering Snow on the Broken Bridge.” Nearby stands a pavilion with an imperial inscription by Emperor Kangxi, adding imperial flair to the view.

From the bridge, you can also see Baidi (Bai Causeway) and Solitary Hill. Climb the hill for vistas of the lake, or wander east to see Gu Shan’s cultural relics, including the Zhejiang Provincial Museum. Wherever you go, remember that West Lake is a living landscape—locals jog, dance, and practise tai chi here. Blend in, move gently, and avoid stepping on grass that’s roped off for restoration.

Now comes your free time. Spend it walking, sipping Longjing tea in a lakeside teahouse, or renting a bicycle to circle the shoreline. Please regroup at six o’clock sharp. Afterward, we’ll share a classic Hangzhou dinner and see why Dongpo Pork became Su Dongpo’s signature dish.
