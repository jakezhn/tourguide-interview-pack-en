Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Hangzhou and thanks for choosing me as your guide. People in China love to say, “Heaven has paradise, and on earth we have Suzhou and Hangzhou.” It’s a bold promise, but I’ll spend the next few minutes showing you why locals say it with a smile.

Let’s start with the map. Hangzhou rests on China’s southeast coast at the lower reach of the Qiantang River and right at the southern end of the 2,300‑year‑old Grand Canal. It covers roughly 16,850 square kilometres and is home to more than 12 million residents, making it the political, economic, cultural, and transportation hub of Zhejiang Province. Even the name tells a story: in ancient Chinese, “hang” meant boat and “zhou” meant city, so the word literally described a city you could sail into.

History here runs deep. Archaeologists have traced human activities back over 8,000 years, and in the 13th century Marco Polo called Hangzhou the most beautiful city in the world. Since then locals have worked hard to live up to that compliment. Today we still blend ancient spirit and modern drive: four high-speed rail stations and Xiaoshan International Airport link us to the world, yet you can still find tea farmers hand-picking Longjing leaves on the hillside.

The weather keeps things interesting. Hangzhou has a subtropical monsoon climate—warm, humid, and very seasonal. Spring brings gentle rain that makes willow trees glow green. Summer is lush and lively, perfect for evening cruises. Autumn feels crisp and poetic; it’s my favourite time for cycling around West Lake. Winter is misty, sometimes snowy, and the stories of Lingering Snow on the Broken Bridge come alive. No matter when you visit, the atmosphere is never dull.

We’re also famous for heritage crafts. Keep your eyes open for Hangzhou silk that feels like water, Longjing green tea, Zhang Xiaoquan scissors made with surgical precision, and the elegant fans from Wang Xing Ji. They’re light in your suitcase but full of stories to share when you go home.

Culturally, Hangzhou is nicknamed the “capital of love.” Classic romances like “The Butterfly Lovers” and “The Legend of the White Snake” were set right here. But beyond romance, Hangzhou projects a modern, innovative, high-quality lifestyle. The city hosts e-commerce giants, high-tech startups, and smart-city pilots while keeping room for slow tea and poetry.

Our highlight reel is long. Of course we’ll talk about West Lake—the UNESCO-listed symbol of the city—but there’s also Lingyin Temple, Xixi Wetland, the bustling Qinghefang Old Street, and the brand-new museums showcasing digital art. Hangzhou cuisine keeps people happy too: taste West Lake Vinegar Fish, Dragon Well Shrimp, and the famous Dongpo Pork created by the great poet-governor Su Dongpo.

During our stay, I’ll balance storytelling with practical tips. We’ll float across the lake by boat, wander through hidden alleys, and sip tea while learning about local customs. If you need special assistance—mobility help, diet needs, extra photo stops—please tell me early so I can arrange it. My job is to keep schedules smooth, but also to keep the journey personal.

I hope my introduction has given you a calm and pleasant first impression of Hangzhou. It is a city of soft landscapes, rich culture, and simple everyday beauty. Thank you for your time.

### English Spoken Script (~750 words)

Friends, before we dive into individual cities, let me sketch the big picture of Zhejiang Province. When Chinese people praise a place, they call it “a land of fish and rice” or “a home of poets and silk.” Zhejiang earns both titles.

Geographically, we stretch along China’s southeastern coastline, forming the southern wing of the Yangtze River Delta. The province covers roughly 105,500 square kilometres—only 1.1 percent of China’s land—but it houses more than 66 million people. The Qiantang River, once called Zhijiang, flows through the province and even gives Zhejiang its name. Mountains and hills make up about seventy percent of the terrain, water fills another ten percent, and the remaining twenty percent is precious farmland. That topography explains our lush tea fields, terraced farms, and winding rivers.

Administratively, Zhejiang oversees 11 prefecture-level cities. Hangzhou is the capital and innovation engine. Ningbo anchors the maritime economy with one of the world’s busiest ports. Wenzhou, Taizhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Quzhou, Zhoushan, and Lishui each contribute their own flavour—whether it’s manufacturing, trade, religion, or eco-tourism. Getting around is easy: nine civilian airports dot the province, high-speed railways stretch more than 1,800 kilometres, and ferries zip between Ningbo, Zhoushan, and Shanghai across the so-called “Golden Triangle” of sea travel.

The timeline here is long. Archaeologists discovered “Jiande Man” from 50,000 years ago, the Hemudu Culture from 7,000 years ago, and the Liangzhu Culture from 5,000 years ago. The Grand Canal in the Sui and Tang dynasties boosted cities like Hangzhou, and by the Southern Song Dynasty Hangzhou was the capital of China while Ningbo became a major port on the Maritime Silk Road. That legacy of openness still shapes Zhejiang’s character today.

Economically, Zhejiang is known as China’s “experiment lab.” Private enterprises thrive here, from family-run workshops to tech giants. The province also leads in digital government, ecological conservation, and rural revitalisation. People here work hard, but they balance it with a refined lifestyle—tea ceremonies, opera, and outdoor sports are part of daily life.

Cultural resources follow suit. Zhejiang hosts 11 items on UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list, including Longquan celadon, Kunqu Opera, blue-dyeing art, and legends like the White Snake. Our tangible heritage is equally impressive: West Lake, the Zhejiang stretch of the Grand Canal, the Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City, and Jianglang Mountain all hold UNESCO World Heritage status. On top of that, we have twenty-one national 5A scenic sites scattered across the province.

To help visitors plan, we divide the province into four tourism metropolitan areas. The Hangzhou metropolitan circle mixes urban leisure, lakeside strolls, and classic water towns. The Ningbo–Zhoushan area highlights island scenery and Buddhist culture at Mount Putuo. The Wenzhou–Taizhou belt delivers dramatic mountains like Yandang as well as folk customs along the Nanxi River. The Jinhua–Yiwu region balances business and culture—you can shop in the world’s largest small-commodity market in the morning and walk into a movie set at Hengdian Studios in the afternoon. Places like Quzhou, Lishui, and the mountainous southwest ride on the same wave, developing integrated tourism that blends ecology, culture, and farm life.

Looking forward, Zhejiang champions “all-area tourism.” Rural homestays, coastal cruises, study camps for students, and health retreats pop up alongside digital museum tours and immersive light shows. The goal is to keep tourism diverse, accessible, and high quality. As your guide, I’ll help you pick the experiences that fit your interests, from tea-picking in Meijiawu to sailing in Zhoushan.

So that’s Zhejiang in a nutshell: compact but powerful, ancient yet modern, and always ready to welcome guests with both business savvy and poetic charm. If any destination catches your imagination, tap me on the shoulder—we’ll make it happen.

浙江省情  
　　　女士们先生们，早上好！欢迎来到中国这片如诗如画的土地 —— 浙江。十分荣幸能担任诸位的导游，希望大家都能拥有一段愉快的旅程！  
　　　每当提及浙江，跃入人们脑海的，往往是诸如 “鱼米之乡”“风景秀丽”“文化昌盛” 之类的溢美之词。浙江将丰富的自然资源与深厚的历史文化底蕴完美融合，吸引着世界各地的无数游客纷至沓来。接下来，请容我花些时间，为大家简要介绍一下浙江。  
　　　浙江地处中国东南沿海，位于长江三角洲南翼。省内最大的河流是钱塘江，其旧称 “之江”，浙江省的名字便由此而来。浙江陆地面积达 10.55 万平方公里，约占中国国土总面积的 1.1%，是中国面积较小的省份之一。不过，这里人口超过 6600 万，是中国人口最为密集的区域之一。  
　　　浙江地势复杂，山峦丘陵多于平原耕地，正如俗语所言：“七山一水二分田”。此地属典型的亚热带季风气候，四季分明，阳光充沛，雨量充足，空气湿润，年平均气温在 15 到 18 摄氏度之间。  
　　　包含省会杭州在内，浙江省下辖 11 个地级市，杭州与宁波更是跻身一线城市之列。浙江的交通网络十分发达，当下省内共有 9 座民用机场；高铁运营里程超 1800 公里；每日还有多趟客轮往返于浙江的宁波、舟山与上海之间——有着 “金三角” 之称的中国最繁忙海上客运区域之一。  
　　　浙江历史源远流长，是华夏古代文明的发祥地之一。早在五万年前的旧石器时代，名为 “建德人” 的原始人类便已在此繁衍生息。七千年前的河姆渡文化以及五千年前的良渚文化，有力地佐证了新石器时代此地古代文明的熠熠光辉。隋唐时期，大运河令杭州等城市声名鹊起；到了南宋，杭州跃升为国都，成为当时全球首屈一指的大都市，宁波也成为海上丝绸之路的重要港口。数千年来，浙江一直在中国占据着举足轻重的地位。时至今日，浙江已成为中国沿海省份中的一颗璀璨明星，在经济、政治、文化、社会及生态领域均成绩斐然。  
　　　浙江文化遗产与手工艺品琳琅满目，共有 11 项入选联合国教科文组织的人类非物质文化遗产代表作名录，诸如龙泉青瓷烧制技艺、昆曲，还有家喻户晓的《白蛇传》传说。要是您正琢磨着带些别具一格的物件回去馈赠亲友，那可选的特产可不少，像杭州丝绸、龙井绿茶、张小泉剪刀、王星记扇子、青田石雕等等。  
　　　说到旅游资源，女士们、先生们，浙江绝对堪称一处自然景观与人文景致相得益彰的仙境。这里坐拥 21 处国家 5A 级旅游景区以及 4 处世界遗产，其中包括 3 处世界文化遗产 —— 杭州西湖、大运河（浙江段）以及良渚古城遗址，还有 1 处世界自然遗产 —— 江郎山。  
　　　在旅游目的地打造方面，浙江堪称全域旅游的先行者与践行者。省内规划有四大都市圈……  

## Script 2 · 大运河（浙江段）

### English Spoken Script (~720 words)

Next up, let’s stroll beside the Zhejiang stretch of the Grand Canal, the southern jewel of the world’s longest man-made waterway. Picture yourself here 1,400 years ago: boats stacked with silk and porcelain slid past quietly, government riders hurried south with instructions, and sleepy-eyed poets leaned on the railings to write about the mist. That same river is still breathing, and today we’ll read it like a simple storybook.

People started digging canals here as early as the Spring and Autumn Period, and by the Sui Dynasty Hangzhou was officially the southern end of the main route. Along with the Great Wall and the Karez wells, the Grand Canal is one of ancient China’s three mega projects. It stretches for more than 3,200 kilometres, crosses eight provinces and municipalities, and touches five big river systems. Zhejiang’s stretch was called the “Official River” because the government paid for it, checked every lock, and kept the traffic safe.

Even today roughly 80% of Hangzhou’s heavy goods still move by water, and you can imagine how lively the banks used to be. Silk workshops, tea warehouses, pharmacies, and opera troupes lined the locks. Merchants sailed north with bags of Zhejiang tea and came back with wheat, salt, or fancy gifts. Because the canal linked inland towns to Ningbo Port, goods could flow straight out to sea.

Culturally, the canal is like a floating library. Writers such as Bai Juyi and Lu You described the bridges, the moonlight, and the sound of oars at night. In 2014 UNESCO listed the Grand Canal as a World Heritage Site, and 18 of those protected spots sit right here in Zhejiang. In 2019 the province even launched the “Grand Canal Poetry Road,” turning the route into a living string of museums and parks.

Today we’ll focus on Xiaohe Street Historical Block. It used to be a worn-down industrial neighbourhood, but careful restoration invited original families back, patched up wooden shophouses, and turned the street into a relaxed row of tea rooms, studios, and cafés. The United Nations even gave Xiaohe a Habitat Award as an example of how heritage can help residents live better.

I’ll give you free time to wander—try the sesame cakes, peek into the workshops, or stand on the pier watching barges slip past the old warehouses. When you hear my call at 10:30, please regroup at the pier so we can hop on the cruise.

Onboard, watch for a few landmarks. To our left sits the Canal Culture Square with the Beijing–Hangzhou Grand Canal Museum. To our right lies Qiaoxi Historical Block, where old factories now host design studios and galleries. Straight ahead is the shining Gongchen Bridge—the tallest and longest old stone arch bridge in Hangzhou. The name means “paying tribute to virtue,” and if you squint you can see the arch bending like someone bowing to welcome the emperor’s boat.

As we pass under the bridge, look up at the carved “water beasts” on the piers. They were meant to calm flooding and they make fun photo moments. After disembarking we’ll climb the bridge for a view and then head to the museum cluster—the Chinese Umbrella Museum, Chinese Fan Museum, and Chinese Knife, Scissor and Sword Museum. Try the interactive exhibits; you can stretch silk onto an umbrella frame or test how fan ribs snap together.

Practical reminder: the canal banks are narrow, so watch your step when taking pictures. Keep your phone and cash handy but safe. Also remember that people still live upstairs in these historic houses, so please keep your voice low in the alleys.

After the cruise, I hope you’ll feel why people here love this waterway. It carries goods, but it also carries identity. Ready for the next story? Let’s keep moving.

**Prompt Words:** canal history opener · 3,200 km length + 8 provinces + “Official River” · 80% Hangzhou cargo & market scenes · poet heritage & UNESCO 18 sites · Xiaohe revival + UN award · free time + 10:30 regroup · cruise spots (Museum Square/Qiaoxi) · Gongchen Bridge & “water beasts” · umbrella/fan/blade museums · etiquette tips · identity wrap-up

## Script 3 · 杭州市西湖风景名胜区

### English Spoken Script (~720 words)

Now we arrive at the heart of Hangzhou’s charm: West Lake. Locals love to say, “There are thirty-six West Lakes across China, but ours is the crown jewel.” The best way to appreciate it is to combine legend, landscape, and a little practical advice, so let me walk you through all three.

The lake covers roughly 6.4 square kilometres, embraced by gentle hills on three sides and the old city on the east. My favourite way to explain the layout is with the classic formula: one hill (Solitary Hill), two pagodas (Leifeng Pagoda and Baochu Pagoda), three islets, three causeways, and five lake sections. Over the centuries the lake has inspired ten famous views with poetic names—Spring Dawn at Su Causeway, Moon over the Peaceful Lake, Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake, and so on. In 2011 UNESCO recognised the West Lake Cultural Landscape as China’s only lake-themed World Heritage site.

Legend says West Lake is a pearl dropped from heaven, guarded by a dragon and a phoenix. Scientists say it used to be a shallow bay connected to the Qiantang River until tide-borne silt sealed it off. Either story works, because the real charm lies in how people shaped the shoreline with gardens, pagodas, and tea houses without ever ruining the view.

We’ll board a boat for a slow cruise. Please hold the rail when stepping on, tuck cameras into a strap, and keep an eye on the breeze—it likes to borrow hats. As the boat glides along, I’ll point out highlights.

First is Su Causeway, a 2.8-kilometre ridge linking the north and south shores. Willows here bud earlier than elsewhere, so “Spring Dawn at Su Causeway” ranks first among the Ten Views. It’s named after Su Dongpo, the legendary poet and governor. During his term, he dredged the lake with 200,000 workers, used the mud to build the causeway, and even created Dongpo Pork by simmering the thank-you gifts villagers brought him.

Next, take out a one-yuan banknote and look at the back. The picture is “Three Pools Mirroring the Moon.” The three hollow stone pagodas rising from the water each have five small holes. On Mid-Autumn night, candles are placed inside, thin paper covers the holes, and the reflections create thirty-three “moons,” including the moon in your heart—the one that represents the people you miss during festivals.

We’ll disembark near the Broken Bridge. According to the legend of the White Snake, Bai Suzhen met Xu Xian here and fell hopelessly in love. In winter, sunlight melts the snow on one side earlier than the other, making the bridge look broken from afar. That scene became another famous view, “Lingering Snow on the Broken Bridge.” Nearby stands a pavilion with Emperor Kangxi’s calligraphy, giving the site an imperial blessing.

From the bridge you can access Bai Causeway and Solitary Hill. Bai Causeway is perfect for leisurely walks, with peach blossoms in spring and reed beds in autumn. Solitary Hill houses art museums, the Zhongshan Park, and hidden tea houses. If you’d like to rent a bike, this is a good place to start; just stick to the designated lanes and ring the bell gently when you pass locals.

A few practical reminders: West Lake is busy year-round, so keep an eye on personal belongings. Stay on the marked paths—lawns often need time to recover from foot traffic. If you’d like a family photo, hand your camera to me; I’ll happily play photographer.

During your free time, consider tasting Longjing tea in a lakeside teahouse, visiting the ornate Chenghuang Pavilion for a panorama, or simply sitting on a bench to listen to street musicians playing the bamboo flute. Please regroup at 6 p.m. sharp so we can head to dinner and sample the very dishes that made Hangzhou cuisine famous.

**Prompt Words:** UNESCO intro · 6.4 km² lake & pearl legend · cruise brief (breeze/hats) · Su Causeway 2.8 km + 200k labourers · Three Pools = 33 moons + ¥1 note · Broken Bridge love + Kangxi plaque · Bai Causeway/Solitary Hill strolling · safety + photo etiquette · free-time Longjing + 6 p.m. meet · dinner teaser

## Script 4 · 良渚古城遗址

### English Spoken Script (~650 words)

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City—the site UNESCO called “the sacred land that proves Chinese civilisation stretches back more than five millennia.” Standing here, surrounded by wetlands and gentle hills, it might be hard to imagine a sophisticated walled city beneath your feet, but let me peel away the centuries for you.

Liangzhu Culture thrived between 5,300 and 4,300 years ago in the lower Yangtze region. Archaeologists describe it as a proto-state, complete with a capital city, organised religion, advanced agriculture, and stunning jade craftsmanship. The ruins park we visit today includes three core elements: the walled city area, the outer water conservancy system, and the Yaoshan altar complex. Together they reveal an urban plan that was carefully zoned for palaces, residences, workshops, and ceremonial squares.

We’ll start at the city gate. Look for the red metal grids marking the rammed-earth foundations. Liangzhu had nine gates in total; this is the only land gate, while the other eight were water gates accessible by boat. Archaeologists even recreated the silhouettes of residents, ox carts, and dogs—yes, dogs were already loyal companions in Liangzhu society.

Next we ascend the Mojiao Mountain Palace District, a huge earthen platform rising ten metres above the plain. The Liangzhu elite believed “height commands respect,” so they piled three smaller terraces—Greater Mojiao, Lesser Mojiao, and Turtle Mountain—on top of the main platform. Postholes show the footprints of houses where rulers lived, held councils, and performed rituals. In front of the platform stretches the 70,000-square-metre Sand Square, an open field likely used for military parades, sacrificial ceremonies, or mass gatherings.

We then visit the Fanshan Cemetery, the highest-ranking tomb complex discovered so far. Archaeologists unearthed more than 1,200 burial objects here, over 90 percent of them jade. The most famous items are the jade cong, jade bi, and jade yue—ritual objects symbolising divine authority, royal power, and military command. Look closely and you’ll see the “divine human-beast” mask carved into the jade, representing the shared beliefs of Liangzhu society. The level of craftsmanship rivals anything made thousands of years later.

Equally impressive is the hydraulic engineering surrounding the city. Liangzhu built the earliest known large-scale water management system in China, complete with dams, reservoirs, levees, and canals. It acted as a moat, provided irrigation, prevented floods, and served as a highway for boats. UNESCO called it the oldest known flood-control project in the world. When you look out over the wetlands today, try to picture Liangzhu engineers directing labourers with wooden shovels and baskets, shaping the land to protect their capital.

The modern ruins park preserves both archaeology and ecology. Most relics remain underground for protection, so the mounds you see are “green museums” marked with plant outlines and interpretive signs. Please stay on the boardwalks, treat the vegetation as part of the exhibit, and follow any instructions from onsite archaeologists—they might be literally holding a 5,000-year-old artefact in their hands.

Liangzhu’s story has a somber end. Scholars believe climate change and catastrophic floods eventually forced residents to abandon the city. Yet the civilisation left a blueprint for later Chinese dynasties: centralised leadership supported by hydraulic control, ritual jade to signal social hierarchy, and a belief system that united people across villages.

As we leave, remember you’ve just walked through evidence that Chinese civilisation didn’t start with bronze weapons or imperial palaces—it was already vibrant here in Liangzhu. That knowledge gives modern Chinese people, and hopefully you too, a deep sense of continuity.

**Prompt Words:** UNESCO framing · 5,300–4,300 yr culture · 9 gates & land gate silhouettes · Mojiao platform + 10 m height · Sand Square 70,000 m² · Fanshan 1,200+ jade artefacts (cong/bi/yue) · earliest dams/reservoirs · boardwalk etiquette · flood/climate legacy

## Script 5 · 嘉兴市桐乡乌镇古镇旅游区

### English Spoken Script (~670 words)

Our journey now heads to Wuzhen, a thousand-year-old water town wedged between Suzhou and Hangzhou. The Grand Canal slices through it, so every corner whispers about merchants, boatmen, and poets. People call it “the last water town,” but when you stroll across its stone bridges you’ll feel how alive it still is.

Wuzhen is divided into two main scenic zones: Dongzha (East Gate) and Xizha (West Gate). Dongzha preserves the everyday rhythm—handmade blue-dye workshops, noodle stalls, traditional pharmacies, and locals chatting along the canals. Xizha focuses on leisure and creative experiences: boutique inns, bookshops, museums, and night cruises lit by lanterns. Together they hosted the first World Internet Conference in 2014, proving that ancient courtyards and modern technology can coexist in one town.

As we explore Dongzha, you’ll notice wooden houses leaning over the water, their reflections broken only by passing boats. We’ll visit the Hundred-Bed Museum where the star is the Qing Dynasty “Babu Qiangong” bed carved with thousands of tiny patterns. If you enjoy literature, stop by the Muxin Art Museum—Muxin, born Sun Pu in 1927, was a Wuzhen native whose dreamy paintings and essays influenced generations.

Cross over to Xizha and the scene changes. White Lotus Pagoda anchors the skyline at 51.75 metres tall. Boardwalks hug the wetlands, cafés overlook the water, and every alley shows a different mix of tradition and trend. At night the lanterns flicker on, music drifts from teahouses, and the reflections turn the town into a painting you can walk through.

Wuzhen’s success comes from thoughtful conservation. Instead of turning the town into a stage set, planners helped original residents refurbish houses and continue their crafts. Streets remain full of life because people live above the shops, children still run across the bridges, and boatmen still shout directions to each other. When you buy souvenirs, try to choose workshops where artisans are present—they’ll happily explain how they weave silk, carve bamboo, or brew rice wine.

Here are a few practical tips. Cobblestones can be slick after rain, so wear shoes with good grip. Boats and electric shuttles are available, but distances are walkable if you take your time. Be respectful when photographing locals—ask first, especially if they’re in their doorway or courtyard. At night, keep noise levels down; remember that every second-story window may belong to a local family winding down for the evening.

During free time you can sip chrysanthemum tea in a riverside teahouse, watch a shadow-puppet show, or try famous Wuzhen snacks such as smoked soybeans and sanbai liquor. If you’re an early riser, stroll along the canal at dawn—fishermen cast nets, mist curls over the water, and you’ll hear nothing but footsteps on stone.

Wuzhen proves that heritage can breathe. As we leave, take one more look at the willow reflections and promise yourself to return—maybe next time for the World Internet Conference, maybe just for another quiet night by the canal.

**Prompt Words:** water-town vibe · Dongzha daily life vs Xizha leisure · 2014 World Internet Conference · Hundred-Bed museum + Muxin art · 51.75 m White Lotus Pagoda · resident-first conservation · artisan shopping tips · wet-cobble safety & photo manners · snacks/dawn walk ideas · poetic farewell

## Script 6 · 舟山市普陀山风景名胜区

### English Spoken Script (~660 words)

Next we sail to Mount Putuo in Zhoushan, one of China’s four sacred Buddhist mountains and home of Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. As soon as the ferry pulls in you’ll smell salt on the wind, hear temple bells mingling with gull cries, and understand why people call this island the “Buddhist Kingdom on the Sea.”

Mount Putuo sits in the Zhoushan Archipelago, facing the East China Sea. Pilgrims have landed here for over a thousand years, often after visiting Mount Wutai, Emei, or Jiuhua. The island covers just under 13 square kilometres, yet it holds more than a dozen temples, countless shrines, beaches, and fishing villages. Our plan combines spiritual highlights with time to soak in the scenery.

We begin at the 18-metre South Sea Guanyin bronze statue. Counting the lotus pedestal and the merit hall beneath, the entire structure stands 33 metres high—symbolising Guanyin’s thirty-three manifestations. Pilgrims circle clockwise, light incense, and whisper wishes for compassion or protection. Feel free to follow the ritual or simply observe quietly.

Nearby stands the “Unwilling-to-Leave Guanyin Temple,” rebuilt in 2001. Legend says a Japanese monk tried to take a Guanyin statue overseas, but the statue refused to move, so locals built a temple to house it. Today the hall combines traditional layout with modern fire safety, making it both atmospheric and visitor-friendly.

As we move inland, take note of the lush vegetation. The 13.5-metre hornbeam tree, more than 200 years old, is considered one of Putuo’s “three treasures.” The island’s microclimate keeps it green year-round, so even in winter the bamboo and camellias look lively.

Our main temple stop is Puji Temple. Walk through the Heavenly Kings Hall and you’ll see Maitreya smiling at the entrance, Weituo guarding the rear, and the Four Heavenly Kings on each side. The complex sits beside an arched bridge and central pond, so every photo looks like a classical painting. Monks chant regularly; please keep voices low and avoid stepping on the threshold as a sign of respect.

A few practical reminders: Putuo involves plenty of stairs, so comfortable shoes are a must. Seafood is delicious here, but if you follow a vegetarian diet there are dedicated temple restaurants. Weather changes fast—carry a light raincoat and secure hats with a strap when the sea breeze picks up. Inside temples, dress modestly and skip flash photography.

After the temple visits we’ll explore the fishing villages. Residents dry seaweed on rooftops, mend nets at the docks, and sell dried fish that make perfect souvenirs. Bargain politely and remember to step aside when villagers push carts—they’re going about normal life. If time allows, we’ll stop by Nanhai Guanyin Cultural Park or the 1,000-step pilgrimage trail that offers sweeping ocean views.

At sunset, find a spot on Purple Bamboo Forest beach. The sand glows gold, waves lap at the rocks, and the silhouette of Guanyin stands watch. Whether you’re religious or simply a lover of natural beauty, Mount Putuo offers the kind of calm that lingers long after you return home.

Our final stop is Yiwu International Trade City, often called the world’s supermarket for small commodities. If you’ve ever bought a Christmas ornament or phone accessory stamped “Made in China,” chances are it passed through Yiwu. Today I’ll show you how a rural barter market turned into a global supply hub.

Yiwu sits in central Zhejiang, about 150 kilometres from Hangzhou. In the early 1980s, farmers set up roadside stalls to trade chicken feathers for sugar—an image that still makes locals grin. From that humble start grew the Futian Market, now an enormous complex with five districts, over 75,000 booths, and more than 400,000 product categories. Markets open around 9 a.m., close after 5 p.m., and welcome buyers from more than 200 countries every day.

Each district specialises. District 1 covers artificial flowers, jewellery, and toys. District 2 sells luggage, hardware, and small appliances. District 3 focuses on stationery, sporting goods, and cosmetics. District 4 is all about hosiery, hats, and textiles, while District 5 showcases imported goods and bedding. Moving walkways connect the halls, so map out your route or you’ll walk a half-marathon without noticing.

To navigate like a pro, remember four tips. First, carry business cards or QR codes so vendors can log your details instantly. Second, know the MOQ—the minimum order quantity. Most booths sell by carton rather than single pieces, though samples can be negotiated. Third, take advantage of onsite services: freight forwarders, customs brokers, quality inspectors, and banks all operate inside the market, so you can place an order, arrange shipping, and track it online before you leave. Fourth, respect intellectual property—Yiwu authorities shut down copycat booths quickly, so work with authorised suppliers and sign clear contracts covering logos and packaging.

Yiwu isn’t just a market; it’s an international community. You’ll hear Arabic, Russian, Spanish, and English in the same aisle. Halal restaurants sit next to Sichuan noodle bars. At night, head to “Exotic Street” near Binwang Market to try Middle Eastern barbecue or African coffee. Live-streaming studios broadcast new gadgets, and start-up designers test prototypes on the spot.

If you need a break from bargaining, visit Xiuhu Park for a lakeside stroll or take a short ride to Fotang Ancient Town to see Ming and Qing architecture. Yiwu also hosts trade fairs year-round, so the city stays lively even during traditional off-seasons.

Practical reminders: wear comfortable shoes and bring water—air-conditioning is strong indoors but you’ll cover serious ground. Keep receipts and double-check product specs before paying deposits. Handle large payments through banks or digital transfers rather than carrying piles of cash. When bargaining, stay patient and friendly; relationships matter more than saving a few yuan.

By the time we board the bus home, I hope you’ll appreciate Yiwu’s hustle. It’s a place where family workshops, global retailers, and curious travellers share the same corridors. There truly is “no deal too small”—and that entrepreneurial spirit is the perfect way to end our Zhejiang journey.
